I am what I am
I can't help myself
And if you don't like it
Get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways
It's not a phase
This is how it is and this is how it's gonna stay
Because
I am what I am I know what I'm not
I'm not the type of guy
That doesn't know what he's got
And I won't back down
Won't come around
Saying that I changed cause
That's not how it's going down

Cause I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!

I am what I am
What can I say?
I'm gonna be this way
Right up until my dying day
Because that's how it goes head to my toes
And if it doesn't show well I just had to let you know
Because

I am what I am
And nobody else
And if you've got a problem
Better take it somewhere else
Because I can't turn back
I'm right on track
And if you think you know
Well then you better check your facts
Because

I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!

Oh can't you see
I'm just being me
I can't be you
And I don't want to be
Don't try to get
Inside my head
Cause what you see is what you get

I am what I am
I can't help myself
And if you don't like it
Get with somebody else
I'll never change my ways
It's not a phase
This is how it is right up until my dying day

And I know (I know, I know)
Wherever I go (I go, I go)
I know where I stand
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
I am what I am
Hey! Hey!
