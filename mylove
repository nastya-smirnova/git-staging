Love
Showed up
At my door
Yesterday
It might sound cheesy
But i wanted her to stay

I fell in love with the pizza
Girl
Now I eat pizza everyday
Oh

I fell in love with the pizza
Girl
Now I eat pizza everyday

I was stuck
In a box
For so long
Now
I say
That the pizza girl
She's the one for me
Yeah

I fell in love with the pizza
Girl
Now I eat pizza everyday
Oh

I fell in love with the pizza
Girl
Now I eat pizza
Now I eat pizza
Now I eat pizza everyday
